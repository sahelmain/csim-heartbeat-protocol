CS5331: Mobile Data Management and Privacy 
Summer II 2025 
 
Project #2: Heartbeat 
 
• Name only: ____________________________________ 
• Release date: July 16, 2025 (Wednesday) 
• Due date: July 23, 2025 (Wednesday), submit through Raider Canvas before midnight, 
11:59 PM  
• It  should  be  done  individually;  No  handwritten  code  or  report;  No  email  submission;  No  late 
homework will be accepted.  
• Total 20 points 
 
1. Implement a simple inter-process communication protocol that exchanges two control packets, Hello 
and Hello_Ack. Refer to the example code shown in lecture note 04.  
• Suppose there are five nodes in a network, where each node is fully connected with others. Each 
node  generates  a  Hello  packet  periodically  by  following  inter-arrival  time,  exponential 
(5.0). You can feel free to change the inter-arrival time for experiments.  
• A sender node (in short, sender) transmits a Hello packet to a randomly chosen receiver node (in 
short, receiver). Upon receiving, the receiver replies to a Hello_Ack packet. If the sender receives 
the  Hello_Ack  packet,  then  the  transmission  is  successful.  Suppose  it  takes  0.2  seconds  to 
transmit  a  packet  over  the  network,  e.g.,  transmission  time.  A  local  processing  delay  before 
replying Hello_Ack is 0.1 second. 
• A packet can be lost during the transmission because of an unreliable link quality. Suppose a set 
of  packet  loss  probabilities  is  0.1,  0.2,  0.3,  0.4,  and  0.5.  If  the  sender  does  not  receive  the 
Hello_Ack  packet  within  a  timeout  period  (2.5  seconds),  it  retransmits  a  Hello  packet.  If  the 
sender still does not receive the Hello_Ack packet, then the transmission fails.  
• Dump a snapshot of events (i.e., a packet loss probability is 0.3). Only one page would be enough. 
For example,  
... 
node.0 sends a Hello to node.3 at 100.2 seconds. 
node.2 replies a Hello_Ack to node.1 at 100.5 seconds 
... 
node.4 sends a Hello to node.3 at 110.5 seconds 
node.1 receives a Hello_Ack from node.2 at 110.6 seconds 
node.4 re-sends a Hello to node.3 at 112.5 seconds 
... 
• The simulation ends when the simulation time reaches 1,000 seconds. Or feel free to change the 
simulation time based on your implementation.   
• Draw  two  result  graphs  in  terms  of  following  performance  metrics  against  the  packet  loss 
probabilities (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5).    
Percentage of successful transmissions  
Percentage of failed transmissions  
 
2. Type the project number and your name (Last, First) at the top in your source code.

4. Compilation & Run:  
• ./csim.gcc proj2_bond_james.c –o proj2_bond_james 
• ./proj2_bond_james 
 
5. What to submit?   
• Source code  
o Your source code file name should be “project number” + “last name” + “first name”, e.g., 
“pro2_bond_james.c”. 
• Report (e.g., pdf) including,  
o Your  report  file  name  should  be  “project  number”  +  “last  name”  +  “first  name”,  e.g., 
“pro2_bond_james.pdf”. 
o Instructions on how to run your program 
o All the simulation parameters or assumption(s) deployed 
o Two result graphs and explanation 
o Any implementation issues or anything you want to mention  
• The TA will compile and run your source code and double-check your results.
